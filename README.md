# GOOD-Model

The GOOD MOdel is a python-translated version of a R and GAMs version developed by Prof. Alan Jenn. The model is a capacity expansion and economic dispatch model used to model transportation electrification impacts on electricity system. 

Use: 

First, open the user_notebook.ipynb. The user notebook is pre-populated with the necessary script to the run the model. The notebook is structured as follows

- Import the data via the data_inputs.py 
- Run the model vai good.py
- Extract the model results via data_outputs.py. 

Due to the size of the model and based on the respective computing power of the server or computer running the model, you may experience models runs up to several hours. This is normal. The model development team continually refining the model to minimize runtime and enable more users to run the model on local machines.
